Kickstarted Crowd Funding Analytics Report - For Louise



-- Introduction --

Hello Louise, I've run the numbers on Kickstarter Crowd Funded Campaigns and have amassed some insights that are sure to deliver clarity to your campaign plan. My goal was to help understand the data on current and previous Kickstarter campaigns (particularly in regards to theater and plays) in order to deliver insights that might help to clarify how to approach the Kickstarter Campaign you'd like to initiate for your play "Fever". As I recall, your planned goal for the "Fever" campaign is $10000+. The insights are listed below:

Through my research I have learned that among 4115 sample Kickstarter campaigns, campaigns in the theater category rank highest in total number of successful campaigns [839 successful campaigns out of 1393 total campaigns].



-- Analysis Overview --

Using the Kickstarter Data, Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Spread, some visualization tools, and few other techniques, I was able to uncover the trends and historical data on campaigns that are close to and/or related to the one you'd like to initiate for "Fever".

I've uncovered theater campaign and play campaign specific success & failure rates. I've analyzed these trends based on the timings of when the Kickstarter were launched (by month)
I've analyzed outcome trends based on campaign initial fundraising goals

There were difficulties maintaining the data, if any cells or rows seem off, please understand that this is only a formatting issue due to some Excel issues, the data is clean, correct, and fully representative.
Additionally, there were instances where calculating the "Average Donation" column in the "Kickstarter" worksheet resulted in an error due to dividing by 0. I've added a functional clause that converts these errors into "0" to allow the data to run correctly. This should technically create the same numerical effect for the "Average Donation" data.



-- Theater Campaigns [General] --

In regards to the theater category specifically, the distribution of outcome for all 1393 campaigns is as follows:

successful - 839
live - 24
cancelled - 37
failed - 493

For plays, specifically, out of a total of 314 campaigns the outcomes are as follows:
successful - 238
live - 6
failed - 70

Delving into the validity and trends of the theater [plays] data, the average goal amount for successful theater [plays] campaigns is around $5,049 while the average amount pledged is $5,602. 
-This means that on average successful plays end up getting funded around 1.11x their initial goal amount
The median goal for successful theater campaigns is $3000 and the Median pledged amount for successful theater campaigns is $3168
Compared to the mean, the median tells us that the data is right-skewed, meaning that a majority of successful theater campaigns aimed for goals less than $3000 *

When referencing failed theater [plays] campaigns, the average goal amount for failed theater [plays] campaigns is $10554 while the average amount pledged for failed theater campaigns is $559.
-This average pledge amount is only 5% of the initial goal amount
The median goal for failed theater campaigns is $5000 and the median pledged for failed theater campaigns is $103
Compared to the mean, the median tells us that the data is right-skewed, meaning that a majority of failed theater campaigns aimed for goals below $5000

What this data is telling us so far is that - although a third identified factor might be at play here - for goal pricing alone there is some threshold in between $3000 and $5000 that may steer a trajectory more toward success or failure. Keeping this in mind is important for our ~$10000+ "Fever" campaign.



-- Timing of Successful Products | Theater Outcomes By Launch Date --

When analyzing the data, We could see noticeable trends around which month a Kickstarter Launched and how successful the majority of those kickstarters were. The graph that goes along with the following analysis report is titled "Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png", if you'd like to follow along.

When filtering by theater campaigns specifically, we see that there is an unusually high spike in successful campaigns during the month of May leading into June. This data would account for every month regardless of year. In other words, year is inconsequential to the validity of this data as all years are considered in the graph.

Conclusion(s):

TL;DR: Basically May-June seems to be the best time of year to launch a (successful) theater Kickstarter campaign *

December also seems to have the lowest amount of successful kickstarter campaigns launched during that month.

Conversely, something to note: the same graph indicates a particular spike in failed theater kickstarters around th emonth of October.



-- Goal Setting for Theater Kickstarter Campaigns | Outcomes Based on Goals --

When considering the effect of campaign goals on success or failure of theater Kickstarter campaigns, we were able to see that different campaign goal ranges produced different relationships between success and failure. The graph that goes along with the following analysis report is titled "Outcomes_vs_Goals.png", if you'd like to follow along.

While the numbers can potentially be contributed to outside forces such as marketing efforts, marketplace standards, and audience. we find that (generally) the higher the campaign goal for theater play campaigns, the higher the likelihood of failure. Unfortunately for "Fever" - proported to be around a ~$10000, it is at this range that we see the highest likelihood for failure from campaigns as can be observed from the "Outcomes_vs_Goals.png" graph.

Conclusion(s):

TL;DR: Beyond a goal for plays between $5000 & $9999, we see high levels of failure followed by a prevailing percentage of failed Kickstarter campaigns. We only see a prevalance of successfult theater campaigns again between the $35000 and $39999 campaign goal range



-- Limitations & Future Research --

During this study there were a few limitations of the dataset that, if addressed could result in more in-depth analysis and clearer insights:

A graph or other information charting the potentiality of cancelled campaigns may have allowed us to understand how likely it might be for a campaign to be funded in time! After all, while a campaign can be funded to completion, it might not be fully funded in time to meet the campaigns particular deadline probably resulting in a cancelled campaign. If we could understand more about the cancelled campaigns, we could probably glean further insight into what factors create a successful campaign.

Additionally, this data does not account for or consider outside factors. Factors that may have played a role outside of the pure numbers could be any or all of the factors included in the following non-inclusive list:
-Were there marketing efforts beyond the campaign?
-Parody or Sequel Plays more effective than original campaigns
-What is the span of campaign success relative to its timeframe (launch-deadline)
-Are there Theater/Play events, competitions, festivals, etc occurring at any time during these campaigns? What is their effect?



-- Outro --
Lousie, I hope this analysis has been helpful in gaining insight on the theater/play kickstarter situation.
While previous data suggests that campaigns beyond a goal of $5000 leads to failure, the data does not account for a plethora of outside factors and doesn't concatenate these failed campaigns to the most successful or least successful months for theater campaigns. Theater/Play Kickstarter campaigns seem to be some of the most successful, so I would suggest launching your campaign within the May_June timeframe, trying to minimize goal/budget however you see possible, and doing a great job in the marketing and materials that go along with your campaign for "Fever".

Best of luck!
